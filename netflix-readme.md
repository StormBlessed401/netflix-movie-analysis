# Netflix Movie Data Analysis üé¨üìä

Welcome to an in-depth exploration of Netflix's movie catalog! This project dives deep into thousands of Netflix movies to uncover fascinating patterns, trends, and insights that tell the story behind one of the world's largest streaming platforms.

## üåü Project Overview

Ever wondered what makes Netflix tick? Which genres dominate their catalog? What movies capture audiences' hearts (and votes)? This analysis answers these burning questions and more. As an avid reader who's always seeking the deeper meaning behind data patterns, I've crafted this project to go beyond surface-level statistics and reveal the underlying stories within Netflix's vast movie collection.

**Eager, able and ready to go** ‚Äì let's dive into the data!

## üéØ Key Research Questions

This analysis is driven by five fundamental questions that unlock insights into Netflix's content strategy and audience preferences:

1. **Genre Frequency Analysis**: What is the most frequent genre in the dataset?
2. **Audience Engagement**: Which genres receive the highest number of votes?
3. **Peak Popularity**: Which movie achieved the highest popularity score and what's its genre?
4. **Underperformers**: Which movie has the lowest popularity and what's its genre?
5. **Production Trends**: Which year saw the highest volume of movie releases?
